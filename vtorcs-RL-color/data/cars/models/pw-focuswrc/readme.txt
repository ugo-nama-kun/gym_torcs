Description             : Ford Focus  WRC

					
			Version 6.1 FINAL 	
			
			I remade the REAL Final Version of the FORD FOCUS WRC car of Colin Mc Rae, I made the car
			the same almost as the NFS 4 version so you have for NFS 3 a REALLY NICE World Rally Car conversion.	
			Enjoy the car in his great performance ! I added 1 New driver , with arms and a steering wheel
			, a Co-Driver who is holding the MAP, a real 3D antenna , a 3D modeled exhaust- pipe, rollbars, DASHboard, 
			a better performance ! ..SO Drive like a Pro , if you can handle it . 
			HAVE LOADS of FUN ...

			Patwo Design production 1999			




			Version 6.0 (FINAL) (6.0 is because all of the FINAL cars are in the 6.x version )

			 
			Well it took me a while to fix the FINAL version , Rocket gave me a good tip on how to make the roof of the car
			not through-lookable anymore, so Thanx Rocket. Also Thomas Egelkraut was very helpful so Thanx 
			Thomas. 

			What is NEW : 
			there are a lot of Graphical Improvements , I will start right here with the list :
			-Added an Interior,with dash in the car , and with sides, bottom ,and NEWLY DESIGNED (by Patwo Design ) Dashboard in the car, 
			2 seats, a Driver, a Co-Driver, both have a body , a helmet and a FACE, the helmets even have a transparant 
			visor, so look very good through the visor to see the faces !!! 2 seats , an inside mirror,
			and 1 Rolbars like in the real one !
			I added a NEW Sound , with the typical Rally Backshifting sound, everyone knows, when you decelerate
			it will bring some 'bangs' in the noise of the engine, like shifiting the Baby a gear back !
			
			Also Much improved AI , when you like to drive now against this car as an opponent, you really need 
			to work and drive like a real Pro , to keep him from finishing first !!!
						
			I fixed the roof, 	
			
			Added a REAL licence-plate on the back  ,
			Added a Ford SUN Banner on the front Window ,
			and the Drivers names are on the side windows !
			
						
			I like to thank all of my friends , who helped me out or gave me some good advice !		

			EVERYONE HAVE LOTS of FUN , this will be the FINAL release of the Toyota Corolla WRC
			THANX Patrick 	
			
			Patwo Design 1999.



			 Version 1.0	
			
			Finally , here it is in the version 1.0 , 
			The tricky part of the car was the modeling, and in the same time, wrecking the mapping 
			on the car. So it was kind of difficult to get the mapping all the way right. But in the 
			end it worked out pretty well after some practise !
			The big problem was how to build the car00.tga file in a way , that the mirroring on the 
			Car would dissapear. 
			Well my first attempts weretoo much effort, especially with the small triangles where you
			could not see what I was doing. So I decided to start as usual again , with the mirroring
			effects, and solve it on the way to the end ! I must say it is pretty good !, not every 
			part of the car can be mirrored back to the right spot, but some of them can ! So the
			result is a car with not very visible mirroring !
				
			Also for the Ford Focus , it is a real life competitor for the Peugeot 306 WRC, I made the car a very good competitor for the other World Rally Cars, not as quick as the 
			Subaru WRC or the Mitsubishi WRC, but they are a different group , so don't worry , as for
			every Rally car they handle like a dream, due to the 4 wheel drive, the car is very stable
			at high speeds and can take corners like you wouldn't believe it , the acceleration is every
			thing on a rally car, so it flies like Hell ! Flying low over the tracks this car loves every
			track especailly with nice corners and a little bit off-road !
			Since Colin Mc Rae moved from Subaru to Ford I could not resist it to make the NEW Ford Focus 
			where Colin Mc Rae is going to drive the Rally 1999 in ! Give it your best shot , after all 
			he is one of the best drivers around !
			Everybody have FUN with it , I all hope you like this NEW WRC and drive it all together with 
			your own rally on NFS3 , ENJOY IT !
			
			Take Care, Patrick 
			
                     		

Installation		:First of all make a new directory in your carmodel 
			directory and name it FOCW. That's all dudes....
			Unzip the file and copy the car.viv file and  everything else
			to the ...\gamedata\carmodel\FOCW  directory.
			Copy the file 28_00.qfs to the NFS3\Fedata\Art\Slides. directory.

			I know that if you do not have the FULL install of NFS3 there is NO directory for the slides 
			to have access to the directory , re-install NFS3 FULL !!!
